# Introduction

# 1st Deliverable
### 1. Video Capture
Firstly, I connected a web camera to my PC and checked that it is being recognised and working properly. The, I installed the Video Library for Processing 3 through the library manager. I copied the code from Example 16-1 and run it. At first, Processing wasn't able to find the camera.

After some searching, I found a solution on the Processing Foundation website. I fixed the code and ran the program again.

### 2. Recoreded Video

First, I studied Examples 16-4 and 16-5 from the Learning Processing website, as well as the speed() method on the Processing website. Then, I created a new sketch and made a "data" folder, where I placed the video I wanted. I combined the previous examples and tweaked the numbers so that the playback speed is controlled the way I wanted.

### 3. QR Code

After downloading the QR Library, I created a QR code for my github profile. I created a "data" folder along with the sketch and place the image there. I followed the code from the example, changed the image source to my own and added the command to open the url that was decoded.

### 4. QR Code - Camera Capture

Using the example from the QR Code Library, I made small adjustments to the code so that there weren't any unecessary processes.

### 5. Augmented Reality

After downloading the NyARToolkit Library and looking through the guide, I created a new sketch and a "data" folder which held the video I wanted to use. I copied the code from the simpleLite example and made a few changes so that my video plays when the Hiro marker is recognised. I noticed that the video wasn't showing up correctly on the marker and tried to fix it by transforming it.
